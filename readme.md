Description: Made a mock up website that is able to pull .json data from a file and display them on DOM. Definitly not my best work. Everything works, but my Name card. I'm missing the img border, the panals are not overlapping correctly, and the response is not well implemented. My grid was messing me up.
Peer review: Mason
The code is well organized and easy to read the site looks just like the mockup however the hover effect other than that clicking through the different cycles of weekly or daily functions smoothly.
